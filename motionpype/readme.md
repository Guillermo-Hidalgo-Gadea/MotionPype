## Todo list

- Clean and filter out legacy code
- Consider moving functions into classes for recurrent object manipulation, such as loading the config file as project, and apply analyze, etc to that project, instead of passing that as function flag.
- add python environment for motionpype and installation yaml

## How to import

Make this installable in Anaconda ```pip install -e .```
or import module with ```python
import sys
importpath = r'path to local download'
sys.path.append(importpath)
import utils
```
